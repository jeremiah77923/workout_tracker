# workout_tracker


Using the power of the sheetify and nutrionx API's, this is a application to track your workouts: 
First the application requests input from the user about what exercises they did today, then 
It uses nurtionx's natural language processing capbilities to parse the exact exercises the user did that 
day from the input they give. Then nutrionx uses its machine learning and data analysis capbilities to estiamte how many calories the user burned with each specific exercise they did. If the user does not specificy how long there exercise was, nurtrionx predicts how long the user did the exercise. These predictions are based upon the user's age, the user's weight, the user's weight, and the user's gender. All of this data is entered in when the user signs up for the service, folllowing them signup the service is implemented through repl and email. Finally the application takes this data and puts in into a google sheet for the user to see. Finally the application also contains a script to remind the user to record their workouts every day at 6 PM.
